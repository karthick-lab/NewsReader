Infosys Buyback Details: Infosys announced details of its largest-ever ₹18,000 crore share buyback program. The news, along with promoters reportedly opting not to participate, fueled a rally in the stock, which was a top gainer on the Sensex, rising over 3%.
Q2 Earnings Announcements:
Colgate Palmolive (India): Reported its Q2 FY26 results, with profit dropping 17% to ₹327.5 crore, and the company also declared a dividend.
Hindustan Unilever (HUL): HUL's shares rose after the company posted its Q2 results (though specific profit details were not in the top snippet, the market reacted positively).
Other major results expected today included Laurus Labs, Andhra Cements, and Sagar Cements.
Tata Motors Restructuring: Tata Motors is set to be renamed to Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) from October 24, completing the demerger process that splits its commercial and passenger vehicle divisions into independent listed entities.
EPack Prefab Technologies Bulk Deal: The smallcap stock surged, hitting a 52-week high, after Bank of America (BofA) purchased over 5.62 lakh shares worth ₹13 crore via a bulk deal.
The stock closed with significant gains.

Market Context: The broader Indian stock market (Sensex and Nifty) traded with volatility but ended marginally higher for the sixth consecutive session.
Initial optimism, largely driven by buzz around a potential India-US trade deal and good corporate earnings, pushed indices to a 52-week high, with the Nifty briefly crossing the 26,000 mark.
However, profit-taking and global cues (like US sanctions on Russian oil firms) erased most of the intraday gains.
IT stocks led the rally.
