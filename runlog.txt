share news is ? Corporate News for Indian Stocks (November 22, 2025)
As today is a Saturday, major announcements from the stock exchanges (BSE/NSE) are typically from the preceding trading day, which was Friday, November 21, 2025.
Here are the Top 5 Corporate News and Market Highlights from Friday, which are likely to influence market sentiment:
1. ? TCS and TPG Joint Venture
News: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and private equity firm TPG Terabyte Bidco will form a joint venture to develop AI data centers.
Impact: The partners plan to invest up to ?18,000 crore (approx.
$2.03 billion) in equity over the next few years, targeting the rapidly growing AI and cloud infrastructure space. This is a significant strategic move for TCS.
2. ? Kotak Mahindra Bank Stock Split
News: The Board of Directors of Kotak Mahindra Bank approved a stock split in the ratio of 1:5 (one equity share of ?5 face value split into five equity shares of ?1 face value).
Impact: A stock split typically makes shares more affordable for retail investors and can increase liquidity, often leading to a short-term positive reaction in the market.
3. ? Reliance Industries (RIL) Crude Import Halt
News: Reliance Industries announced that it has halted the import of Russian crude oil for processing at its export-oriented Jamnagar refinery to comply with European Union sanctions.
Impact: The company stated that exports from this refinery will be entirely from non-Russian oil starting December 1. This strategic realignment of its supply chain is a significant business development due to geopolitical factors.
4. ?? IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation) Investment Plan
News: IndiGo approved a ?7,294 crore investment in its arm, InterGlobe Aviation Fin Services, to acquire aircraft assets.
Impact: This large capital commitment highlights the company's aggressive fleet expansion and growth strategy in the aviation sector.
5. ? Market Movement & Sectoral Performance
News: The Indian stock market benchmarks, Sensex and Nifty 50, closed lower on Friday, ending a two-day winning streak.
Reasons: Profit-booking after hitting a 52-week high, weak global cues, growing concerns over the India-US trade deal, and a fall in heavyweight banking stocks (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI).
Top Losers: Metals and banking stocks, including JSW Steel, Hindalco, Tata Steel.
